|-----|---------|
| Business Situation - Read | Read situation data |
| Business Situation Type - Read | Read situation type data |
| Purchase Requisition Integration API | Contract ready action |
| Physical Inventory Document Integration API | Inventory monitoring action |

## Role Templates

| Role | Type | Access |
|------|------|--------|
| SituationAutomationKeyUser | Key User | Full application access |
| SituationAutomationAdminUser | Admin | System onboarding only |
| RuleRepositorySuperUser | Rules | Business rule authoring |

### Key User Tiles

Key users with SituationAutomationKeyUser role can access:

1. **Manage Situation Actions** - Create custom actions
2. **Manage Situation Automation** - Configure automation rules
3. **Situation Dashboard** - View situation overview
4. **Analyze Situations** - Analyze resolution flows
5. **Delete Data Context** - Manage data retention
6. **Explore Related Situations** - View situation relationships

## Event Mesh Configuration

### Topic Space
```
saas/isa/cons
```

### Outbound Event Topics
```
sap/s4/beh/businesssituation/v1/BusinessSituation/*
sap/s4/beh/businesssituationtype/v1/BusinessSituationType/*
```

### Topic Rules (Service Instance)
```json
{
  "topicRules": {
    "publishFilter": [],
    "subscribeFilter": ["saas/isa/cons/*"]
  }
}
```

## Destination Configuration

### Key Constraints

1. **Single System Per Subaccount**: One subaccount connects to one S/4HANA system only
2. **Base URL Only**: Destination URL must contain only the base system URL (no paths)
3. **Same System Destinations**: All destinations in a subaccount must point to the same system

### Changing Connected System

To connect to a different S/4HANA system:
- Option A: Create a separate subaccount
- Option B: Unsubscribe and resubscribe with new destination

## Onboarding Workflow

### Prerequisites

1. Administrator role assigned
2. Event Mesh enabled in subaccount
3. Destination configured to S/4HANA system
4. Communication arrangements created (Cloud) or APIs exposed (On-premise)

### Steps

1. **Expose Situation Handling APIs** (in S/4HANA)
2. **Configure Destinations** (in BTP Cockpit)
3. **Set Up Event Mesh Communication** (Event channel + topic bindings)
4. **Onboard System** (using Onboard System app)

### Onboard System App Process

1. Launch *Onboard System* application
2. Click *Add*
3. Select destination from list
4. Click *Check Connection* to verify
5. Enter system name and description
6. Click *Create*
7. Wait for status: *Pending* → *Successful*

**Troubleshooting**: If onboarding fails, hover over info icon for details. Use *Retry* after fixing issues.

## Automatic Situation Resolution

### Supported Situation Templates

| Template | Code | Required Scenario |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Contract is Ready as Source of Supply | PROC_CONTRACTREADYTOUSE_V3 | SAP_COM_0102 |
| Physical Inventory Monitoring | MAN_PHYSICAL_INVENTORY_MONITOR | SAP_COM_0107 |

### Custom Actions

Use the *Manage Situation Actions* application to create custom actions beyond standard SAP actions.

## Data Export

Export all stored data using the endpoint:
```
[https://<subdomain>.<region>.intelligent-situation-automation.cloud.sap/exportdata](https://<subdomain>.<region>.intelligent-situation-automation.cloud.sap/exportdata)
```

## Audit Logging

Intelligent Situation Automation uses the Audit Log service to track:
- Changes to automation configurations
- System onboarding events

View logs via the Audit Log Viewer in Cloud Foundry.

## Unsubscription Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Administrator role for the subaccount
- Data export completed (if needed)

### Steps to Unsubscribe
1. Open your global account in the SAP BTP cockpit
2. Navigate to your subaccount
3. In the navigation area, choose **Services > Instances and Subscriptions**
4. Find Intelligent Situation Automation in the subscription list
5. Select the three dots at the end of the subscription row
6. From the menu, select **Delete**
7. Confirm deletion - all application data will be removed

## Common Issues (Legacy)

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Server error on app access | Missing role assignment | Assign required role collections |
| No Action Applied | Rule conditions don't match | Revise rule and reactivate |
| No Automation Configuration Found | No automation exists for situation type | Create automation in Manage Situation Automation |

- ✅ Bind both BusinessSituation and BusinessSituationType topics
- ✅ Use SAP_COM_0092 for cloud event channels

### User Management
- ✅ Assign SituationAutomationAdminUser for onboarding tasks
- ✅ Assign SituationAutomationKeyUser for daily operations
