## Runtime and Programming Model Selection

For detailed runtime comparison: See `references/runtimes.md`

### Decision Matrix

| Criteria | CAP (Cloud Foundry/Kyma) | ABAP Cloud |
|----------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Languages** | Node.js, Java, TypeScript | ABAP |
| **Best For** | New cloud-native apps, extensions | Organizations with ABAP expertise |
| **Runtime** | Cloud Foundry or Kyma | SAP BTP ABAP Environment |

| **UI Framework** | SAP Fiori Elements, SAPUI5 | SAP Fiori Elements, SAPUI5 |
| **IDE** | SAP Business Application Studio, VS Code | ABAP Development Tools (Eclipse) |

### CAP Application Development

CAP provides three operational profiles:
- **Development**: Mock services, minimal setup, SQLite/H2 for local testing
- **Hybrid**: Local app connected to cloud services
- **Production**: Full cloud deployment with SAP HANA Cloud

Key capabilities:
- Domain-driven design with CDS (Core Data Services)
- Built-in multitenancy support
- Automatic OData/REST service generation
- Platform-agnostic design (no vendor lock-in)

For CAP details: See `references/cap-development.md`

### ABAP Cloud Development

ABAP Cloud uses four foundational technologies:
1. **Core Data Services (CDS)** - Data modeling and analytics
2. **ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)** - Service-oriented development
3. **Restricted ABAP Language** - Cloud-safe API access
4. **Released Public APIs** - Upgrade-stable extensions

For ABAP details: See `references/abap-cloud.md`

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Explore and Discover

1. **Identify business problem** - Conduct stakeholder interviews
2. **Understand user needs** - Visit customers, observe workflows
3. **Define security requirements** - Threat modeling, compliance planning (GDPR, HIPAA)
4. **Establish governance** - Set up organizational structure

### Phase 2: Design

1. **User Experience Design**
   - Follow SAP Fiori Design Guidelines
   - Implement accessibility (WCAG 2.2)
   - Use design thinking methodology

2. **Technology Design**
   - Apply Domain-Driven Design for complex applications (30+ use cases)
   - Define module boundaries and communication patterns
   - Plan microservices architecture if needed

3. **Security in Design**
   - Secure user interfaces with SAP Fiori authentication
   - Implement RBAC/ABAC using OAuth/OpenID Connect
   - Validate CDS models for data protection

For design patterns: See `references/design-patterns.md`

### Phase 3: Develop

**CAP Development:**
```bash
# Initialize CAP project
cds init my-project
cd my-project

# Add SAP HANA support
cds add hana

# Add authentication
cds add xsuaa

# Run locally
cds watch
```

**Key development tools:**
- SAP Business Application Studio (primary IDE)
- SAP Cloud SDK (OData/OpenAPI clients)
- MTA Build Tool (packaging)

**Coding standards:**
- Follow SAPUI5 Guidelines and SAP Fiori Design Guidelines
- Establish naming conventions
- Implement parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Use CDS constraints for input validation

For tools catalog: See `references/tools.md`

### Phase 4: Deploy

**Cloud Foundry Deployment:**
```bash
# Build MTA archive
mbt build

# Deploy to Cloud Foundry
cf deploy mta_archives/my-project_1.0.0.mtar
```

**Kyma Deployment:**
```bash
# Use Helm charts or Terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**ABAP Deployment:**
- Use Manage Software Components app (gCTS)
- Transport via Landscape Portal
- Partner options: Multitenant SaaS or Add-on Product

For deployment details: See `references/deployment.md`

### Phase 5: Run and Scale

**Monitoring:**
- SAP Cloud ALM (central observability)
- SAP Cloud Logging (detailed logs, metrics, traces)
- ABAP Technical Monitoring Cockpit

**Scaling:**
- Cloud Foundry: Automatic instance distribution across AZs
- Kyma: Kubernetes-native scaling
- ABAP: Elastic scaling with ACUs (0.5 ACU increments)

**Cost optimization:**
- System hibernation (ABAP) - reduce to <5% operational cost
- SAP HANA Cloud Native Storage Extension
- Elastic Compute Nodes for peak workloads

For operations: See `references/operations.md`
