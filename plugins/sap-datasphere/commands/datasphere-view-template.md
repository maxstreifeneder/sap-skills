## Template: graphical (dimension)

### Graphical View - Dimension

**View Name**: `dim_<entity>`
**Semantic Usage**: Dimension
**Purpose**: Master data for analytical reporting

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Create View**
   - Open Data Builder > Views
   - Click "New Graphical View"
   - Select source table/view

2. **Configure Columns**
   ```yaml
   Columns:
     - Name: <ENTITY>_ID
       Key: Yes
       Semantic: Identifier

     - Name: <ENTITY>_NAME
       Key: No
       Semantic: Text

     - Name: <ENTITY>_DESC
       Key: No
       Semantic: Description

     - Name: VALID_FROM
       Key: No
       Semantic: Business Date (from)

     - Name: VALID_TO
       Key: No
       Semantic: Business Date (to)
   ```

3. **Set Semantic Usage**
   - Semantic Usage: **Dimension**
   - Expose for Consumption: **Yes**

4. **Configure Associations**
   ```yaml
   Associations:
     - Target: Text Entity (if separate)
       Type: Text Association
       Join: <ENTITY>_ID = TEXT_ENTITY_ID
       Language: LANGUAGE_KEY
   ```

5. **Add Hierarchy (Optional)**
   ```yaml
   Hierarchy:
     Type: Level-Based
     Levels:
       - Level 1: REGION
       - Level 2: COUNTRY
       - Level 3: CITY
   ```

**Semantic Usage**: Fact
**Purpose**: Transactional data with measures

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Create View**
   - Open Data Builder > Views
   - Click "New Graphical View"
   - Add fact table as source

2. **Add Joins** (to dimensions)
   ```yaml
   Joins:
     - Type: Left Outer
       Source: fact_sales
       Target: dim_product
       On: PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT_ID

     - Type: Left Outer
       Source: fact_sales
       Target: dim_customer
       On: CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ID
   ```

3. **Configure Measures**

   Measures:
     - Name: QUANTITY
       Aggregation: SUM

     - Name: REVENUE
       Aggregation: SUM

     - Name: UNIT_PRICE
       Aggregation: AVG

     - Name: DISCOUNT_AMOUNT
       Aggregation: SUM
   ```

4. **Configure Dimensions** (Foreign Keys)
   ```yaml
   Dimension Columns:
     - Name: PRODUCT_ID
       Association: dim_product

     - Name: CUSTOMER_ID
       Association: dim_customer

     - Name: DATE_KEY
       Association: dim_time
   ```

5. **Set Semantic Usage**
   - Semantic Usage: **Fact**
   - Expose for Consumption: **Yes**

## Semantic Configuration Reference

### Semantic Usage Types

| Type | Use Case | Expose |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Fact** | Transactional data with measures | Yes |
| **Dimension** | Master data for filtering/grouping | Yes |
| **Text** | Language-dependent descriptions | Usually No |
| **Hierarchy** | Hierarchical relationships | Usually No |
| **Relational Dataset** | Intermediate/staging views | Optional |
| **Analytical Dataset** | Deprecated, use Analytic Model | N/A |

### Association Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Association** | Link to dimension | fact_sales → dim_product |
| **Text Association** | Link to text table | dim_product → text_product |
