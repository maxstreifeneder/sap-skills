{{#if version}}
Fetching information for UI5 version **{{version}}**...
{{else}}
Detecting project UI5 version and fetching information...
{{/if}}

## Version Detection

First, let me determine which UI5 version to query:

```bash
# Check project manifest.json
if [ -f "webapp/manifest.json" ]; then
  VERSION=$(grep -oP '"minUI5Version":\s*"\K[^"]+' webapp/manifest.json)
  echo "Project UI5 Version (manifest.json): $VERSION"
fi

# Check ui5.yaml
if [ -f "ui5.yaml" ]; then
  YAML_VERSION=$(grep -oP 'version:\s*"\K[^"]+' ui5.yaml)
  echo "UI5 Tooling Version (ui5.yaml): $YAML_VERSION"
fi

# Check package.json
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  PKG_VERSION=$(grep -oP '"@ui5/cli":\s*"\^\K[^"]+' package.json)
  echo "UI5 CLI Version (package.json): $PKG_VERSION"
fi
```

{{#if version}}
Using specified version: **{{version}}**
{{else}}
Using detected project version (or latest if no project found)
{{/if}}

## Manual Version Lookup (If Tools Unavailable)

If automated tools are unavailable, here's manual lookup information:

### Project Version Detection

```bash
# Detect from manifest.json
MANIFEST_VERSION=$(grep -oP '"minUI5Version":\s*"\K[^"]+' webapp/manifest.json 2>/dev/null || echo "Not found")

# Detect from ui5.yaml
YAML_VERSION=$(grep -oP 'version:\s*"\K[^"]+' ui5.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "Not found")

# Detect from index.html (bootstrap script)
HTML_VERSION=$(grep -oP 'ui5\.sap\.com/\K[0-9.]+' webapp/index.html 2>/dev/null || echo "Not found")

echo "Detected Versions:"
echo "  manifest.json: $MANIFEST_VERSION"
echo "  ui5.yaml:      $YAML_VERSION"
echo "  index.html:    $HTML_VERSION"
```
