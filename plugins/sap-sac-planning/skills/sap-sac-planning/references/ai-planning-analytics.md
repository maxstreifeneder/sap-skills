# AI for Planning & Analytics (SAC 2025.23)

Source: 002-ai-planning-analytics.md.

## Key capabilities
- **Just Ask / Search to Insight**: natural language queries; use for quick checks and to seed stories.
- **Smart Predict / Predictive Planning**: time-series forecasts feeding planning versions; pair with predictive steps in multi actions.
- **Smart Insights / Smart Discovery**: driver analysis to explain variances; useful before setting allocations.

## When to apply in planning
- Pre-allocations: use Smart Insights to find drivers, then set allocation drivers accordingly.
- Forecast cycles: run predictive forecasts into private versions, validate, then publish.
- Ad-hoc questions during planning meetings with Just Ask to reduce manual slice-and-dice.

## Guardrails
- Validate AI outputs before publish; keep in private versions for review.
- Ensure model permissions align; AI respects data access control.
