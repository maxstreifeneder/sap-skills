# Input & Review Tasks (SAC 2025.23)

Purpose: structure human data collection and approvals for planning.

## Task types
- **Input Task**: assign data entry on a planning model slice.
- **Review Task**: request approval/feedback after input.
- **Composite Task**: bundle input + review + dependencies.

## Setup essentials (010, 011)
- Select model and version; define scope (dimensions/time) for assignees.
- Set due dates, reminders, and recurrence if needed.
- Attach instructions/files; add reviewers for approval path.
- Track status in calendar; tasks can gate subsequent automated steps.

## Good practices
- Align task scope with planning area to avoid partial edits during actions.
- Use clear naming including model/version and period.
- Keep dependencies minimal but explicit for sequencing.
