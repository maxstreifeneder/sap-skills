# Value Help in Script Editor (2025.23)

Source: `help-portal-407bdedb4fd74f3aa2a3bd7b8b8d812e.md`.

## How to invoke
- Press `CTRL + SPACE` in the script editor for context-aware suggestions.

## Contexts
- **Measures**: opens measure metadata selector.  
- **Variable values**: for dimension variables, opens member selector; non-dimension variables show values in completion list.  
- **Selection objects**: offers keys (dimensions) and values (dimension members) for the associated data source; works after dot access on selection object.

## Notes
- Use value help to avoid typos in member IDs, variables, and selection object properties.
- For dimension properties, value help includes member values for comparisons/assignments.
