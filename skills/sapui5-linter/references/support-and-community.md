# UI5 Linter - Support and Community Resources

**Source**: https://github.com/UI5/linter/blob/main/SUPPORT.md
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-21
**UI5 Linter Version**: 1.20.5

## Overview

This guide helps you get support for UI5 Linter issues, connect with the community, and choose the right channel for different types of questions or problems.

---

## ⚠️ Important: Do NOT Use GitHub Issues for Questions

**GitHub Issues are for**:
- ✅ Bug reports (confirmed issues)
- ✅ Feature requests
- ✅ Documentation problems

**GitHub Issues are NOT for**:
- ❌ Setup help
- ❌ General questions ("How do I...")
- ❌ Configuration assistance
- ❌ Troubleshooting guidance
- ❌ Best practices discussions

**Why**: GitHub Issues are for tracking development work, not community support. Questions in issues slow down the development process.

## Official Support Channels

### 1. StackOverflow ⭐ Recommended for Questions

**URL**: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ui5-tooling

**Tag**: `ui5-tooling`

**Best For**:
- General questions about UI5 Linter
- Configuration help
- Troubleshooting linting issues
- Best practices
- "How do I..." questions

**How to Ask**:
```markdown
**Title**: Clear, specific question
Example: "How do I configure UI5 Linter to ignore test files?"

**Tags**: ui5-tooling, sapui5 (or openui5)

**Question Body**:
1. What you're trying to achieve
2. What you've tried
3. What's not working
4. Relevant code/configuration
5. Environment (UI5 Linter version, Node version, OS)
```

**Example Question**:
```markdown
# How do I fix no-globals rule errors in my UI5 project?

I'm getting `no-globals` rule violations when using `sap.ui.getCore()`.

## What I've Tried
- Running `ui5lint --fix` but it doesn't fix all occurrences
- Checked documentation for autofix limitations

## Configuration
```javascript
// ui5lint.config.mjs
export default {
  ignores: ["webapp/thirdparty/**"]
};
```

## Environment
- UI5 Linter: 1.20.5

## When to Use Each Channel

### Use StackOverflow When:
- ✅ You have a well-defined question
- ✅ Answer would benefit others (searchable)
- ✅ You need detailed, documented response
- ✅ You can wait a few hours for answer
- ✅ You want permanent reference

**Examples**:
- "How does the autofix feature work?"
- "What's the best way to configure linter for monorepo?"
- "How do I integrate UI5 Linter with ESLint?"

---

### Use Slack When:
- ✅ You need quick clarification
- ✅ You're troubleshooting in real-time
- ✅ You want to discuss approach before implementing
- ✅ You have a time-sensitive question
- ✅ You want community feedback

**Examples**:
- "Quick question: Does --fix work on manifest.json?"
- "Anyone seen this error before? [screenshot]"
- "What's the recommended ignore pattern for Fiori Elements apps?"

---

### Use GitHub Issues When:
- ✅ You found a confirmed bug
- ✅ You have feature request with detailed use case
- ✅ Documentation is incorrect or missing
- ✅ You can provide reproduction steps

**Examples**:
- "Rule no-globals doesn't detect sap.ui.getCore() in arrow functions"
- "Feature Request: Add autofix for deprecated Button.tap event"
- "Documentation: Autofix limitations page missing Core API examples"

**Process**:
1. Confirm it's actually a bug (not configuration issue)
2. Search existing issues
3. Use issue template
4. Provide reproduction steps
5. Include environment details

See [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) for full details.

---

### Step 2: Search Existing Issues

```
https://github.com/UI5/linter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+YOUR+SEARCH+TERMS
```

**Common Searches**:
- "no-globals autofix"
- "manifest version error"
- "performance slow"
- "configuration not found"

---

### Step 3: Enable Verbose Logging

```bash
ui5lint --verbose --details
```

**Output includes**:
- Configuration loading details
- File processing information
- Rule execution details
- Detailed error messages

---

### Step 4: Try Dry-Run for Autofix

```bash
UI5LINT_FIX_DRY_RUN=true ui5lint --fix
```

**See what would change** without modifying files.

---

### Step 5: Isolate the Issue

**Create minimal reproduction**:
```bash
# Create test directory
mkdir ui5lint-test
cd ui5lint-test

# Create minimal file
cat > test.js << 'EOF'
sap.ui.define([], function() {
  return sap.ui.getCore();
});
EOF

# Test
ui5lint test.js
```

**If issue reproduces**: Great for asking help with minimal example

**If issue doesn't reproduce**: Problem is in your configuration or other code

## Security Issues

**🔒 SPECIAL PROCESS FOR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create public GitHub issue
- ❌ Post in Slack
- ❌ Post on StackOverflow
- ❌ Discuss publicly anywhere

**DO**:
- ✅ Follow [Security Policy](https://github.com/UI5/linter/security/policy)
